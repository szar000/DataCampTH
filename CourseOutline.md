# Classification with scikit-learn
## Chapter 1: Data Preprocessing and Model Selection
### Lesson 1.1: Dealing with Data Imperfections
- Learner will be comfortable with using `SimpleImputer` and deciding wether to use the mean or the most_frequent category value dependent on type of column data
- Learner will be able to identify standardization issues with `df["column].unique`, such as inconsitent dateformats and solve them using prior Python knowledge
- Learner will be able to detect and discard outliers using `IsolationForest`
- Keywords and new syntax: `SimpleImputer`,`IsolationForest`
### Lesson 1.2: Encoding and Scaling Data
- Learner will be able to correctly assess when to use `OneHotEncoder` vs. `LabelEncoder`
- Learner will be able to determine which estimators require data sclaing via `StandardScaler`  
- Keywords: `OneHotEncoder`, `LabelEncoder`, `StandardScaler`
### Lesson 1.3 Model Selection
- Learner will consult the machine learning map (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html) and be able to choose the correct approach
- Keywords: model selection
# Chapter 2: k-Nearest Neighbors
